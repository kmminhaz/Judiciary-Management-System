            <h3>Judiciary History of Bangladesh</h3>
            <p>
              The judicial system of Bangladesh has a known history of over
              thousands of year. The present judicial system of Bangladesh has
              been evolved as a result of gradual process during the different
              period of Indian history. Legal history of Bangladesh can be
              divided under four important periods, i.e., Hindu period, Muslim
              period, British period and after independence. During ancient
              times, the justice system was connected with religion and with
              social norms. The king (raja) was the supreme head of the
              legislative, executive and judiciary branches. The various sources
              of law relied upon by the kings at that time were shrutis,
              smritis, puranas, dharmashastras, etc. The Arthashastra and
              Manusmriti were considered authoritative legal guidance. Hindu
              period extended for nearly 1500 years. Muslim period started with
              the first major invasion by Muslims in 1100 A.D. The Muslim
              emperor followed the laws of the Holy Quran, Sunnah, Ijma and
              Qias. During Muslim period the civil administration of Sultanate
              and head of highest court was Sultan. The Sultan was assisted by
              two reputed Muftis. During Muslim period the Court was regulated
              by two Muslim Codes, namely- Fiqh-e-Firoz Shah and
              Fatwa-i-Alamgiri. British period begins with the consolidation of
              the British power in the middle of the eighteenth century and last
              for nearly two hundred years. Grant of Charter of 1661 by Charles
              II empowered the East India Company to administer the people who
              lived in the Company’s factories or trading centers at the three
              presidency towns namely- Madras, Bombay and Calcutta, both civil
              and criminal justice according to English law. The Charter of 1668
              authorized the Company to make laws, orders, ordinances and
              constitutions for the good governance of the island of Bombay. By
              dint of Charter of 1686, the Company in 1687 was authorized to
              establish a municipality and a Mayor’s Court at Madras to try the
              civil and criminal cases in their territories. Similar courts were
              established in successive presidencies at Bombay and Calcutta. The
              story of India’s modern judiciary begins with the Mayor’s courts
              which were established in the presidency towns of Calcutta, Madras
              and Bombay in 1728 under charter of 1726 by king Gorge-I to try
              all civil actions. The Charter also provided that in each
              presidency town, the Governor and five senior members of the
              Council will have criminal jurisdiction and would be justices of
              the Peace and provisions for filling of the appeals from the then
              India to the Privy-Council in England was introduced by the
              Charter. The charter establishing the Supreme Court of Judicature
              at Fort William was issued in 1774 in pursuance of Regulating Act
              1773. During the period of 1834 to 1861, two sets of courts were
              administering justice in India. The king’s Court and Company’s
              Court formed the dual system of courts having their separate
              jurisdiction. After the Judicial Committee Act, 1833, the Privy
              Council came to be called the Judicial Committee of the Privy
              Council. The Mutiny in 1857 necessitated rethinking on the
              administration of India and reorganization of the law of courts.
              In 1858 the East India Company was abolished and the assumption of
              direct responsibility of the Government of India by the Crown made
              the problem of uniting the two sets of courts much easier. As a
              result, Indian High Court Act, 1861 was passed. The act of 1861
              empowered the Crown to establish by Letters Patent, High Courts of
              Judicature at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay abolishing the Supreme
              Courts and the Courts of Sadar Diwani Adalat and Sadar Nizamat
              Adalat. The Government of India Act, 1915 was passed by British
              Parliament which provided for the constitution, jurisdiction and
              powers of the High Courts. Under the Provisions of the Government
              of India Act, 1935 a Federal Court was established in India in
              1937 having power to hear appeals from the decisions of the High
              Courts. But the said appellate power was limited to the
              interpretation of laws vis-a-vis the Government of India Act and
              did not affect the jurisdiction of the Privy Council to hear
              appeals from the decisions of the High Courts on merit. The High
              Court of Bengal (Order) 1947 promulgated under the provisions of
              section 9 of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 providing for
              establishing a separate High Court for East Pakistan as the High
              Court of Judicature of East Bengal at Dhaka. Under the provision
              of the Federal Courts Order 1947, Federal Court of Pakistan was
              established in Karachi under the provisions of the Privy Council
              (Abolition of Jurisdiction) Act, 1950. The jurisdiction of Privy
              Council to appeals was taken away and the same power was vested in
              the Federal Court of Pakistan. With the coming into operation of
              the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1956 the
              Supreme Court of Pakistan was established in place of Federal
              Court as Apex Court of the country. After independence of
              Bangladesh in 1971 the Acting President promulgated the Laws
              Continuance Enforcement Order, 1971 by which all laws that were in
              force in Bangladesh on 25th March, 1971 continued to be so in
              force. At present we have about 740 Acts, 507 Ordinances and some
              Regulations in Bangladesh.
